# Quantum-Puzzle
Puzzle game, written in python.

Simple to play (Even has a tutorial)

The game is mostly proof of concept at this point. It's not very challenging or engaging, but it's not meant to be. 
Maybe further down the line...


**Installation:**

 - Open a terminal (usually Ctrl+Alt+T) 
 - Navigate to the folder you want to downloaded it to.
 - Clone the repository to that file
 
  Example:
  
 ```{r, engine='sh', count_lines}
cd ~/Downloads/ 
git clone https://github.com/JojoNedich/Quantum-Puzzle
```
Note:
You may need to install git:
 ```{r, engine='sh', count_lines}
sudo apt-get install git
```

**To start the game** simply navigate to the folder and run game.py

Example:

 ```{r, engine='sh', count_lines}
 cd ~/Downloads/Quantum-Puzzle/
 python3 game.py
```

Follow the instructions in the game.
Includes a tutorial, so you won't be lost as to what to do.
